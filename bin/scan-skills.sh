# Scan the skills under skills/ with NVIDIA SkillSpector and fail on any
# non-suppressed finding.
#
# Adapted from crodris/skills (MIT) — bin/scan-skills.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/scan-skills.sh [skill ...]   # default: every skills/<name>/ with a SKILL.md
#
# Environment:
#   SKILLSPECTOR_LLM=1   also run the LLM semantic stage (requires provider credentials,
#                        e.g. SKILLSPECTOR_PROVIDER=anthropic + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
#   REPORT_DIR=<dir>     write per-skill JSON and Markdown reports into <dir>
#
# Known false positives are suppressed via the repo-root .skillspector-baseline.yaml,
# with an auditable reason per suppression. Suppressed findings still appear in the
# JSON reports under "suppressed".
#
# Two properties this script exists to guarantee:
#
#   1. Each skill is scanned exactly once, and the Markdown report is rendered from
#      that scan's JSON. The scanner is not fully deterministic, so a re-scan to
#      produce the report could contradict the verdict that gated CI.
#   2. A scanner crash is not a clean skill. Crashes are counted separately from
#      findings and fail the run with their own message, so a skill that was never
#      assessed is never reported as passing.
